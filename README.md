# Portfolio
A visually stunning, interactive portfolio website showcasing technical expertise.
## What's done
- Employed React for dynamic UI, Node.js for backend, Email.js for contact forms, and SASS for styling.
- Integrated interactive Map (react-leaflet), optimized page loading (loader.css), and dynamic animations (animate.css).
- Demonstrated proficiency in frontend development, backend integration, UX design, and responsive web development.
- Unable to deploy the website to a hosting platform because GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) requires a paid plan for its use.
